What does it do
---------------
It basically turns jumpers into cheap (and not as accurate) touch sensors, aka Native Capacitive Sensors, taking only 1 digital pin.  

How to use it
-------------
The only function returns integer between 1-17. If the bare end of the jumper attached to “pinToMeasure” is pressed by your finger, (ONLY TESTED WITH USB POWER SOURCE)
the return value would be 2 or more
